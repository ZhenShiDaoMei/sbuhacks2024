# Brain DrAIn  
Built during SBUHacks - 2024  

## Overview  
Brain DrAIn is a mobile app created to help students study and prepare for tests. We we're given 24 hours at SBUHacks, and our goal as a team was just to have fun, learn new languages and learn how to use chatGPT API (prompt engineering).  

## How It Works / Features  
The main concept behind the app is to generate a prompt using the topic given by the user, and the user has a set amount of time to memorize the prompt. We them remove key words and the user has to fill in the blanks. We take advantage of active recall to help users memorize key definitions and important words pertaining to certain topics. 
* Use chatGPT API to generate unique passages on given topic.
* Use chatGPT API to give hints to help user fill in the blank.
